/*
Project Management


Key Notes:
Packages -> build, test, share crates
Crates -> tree of modules which make a library
Modules ->"use" statements, control organization, scope and privacy of paths
Paths -> how an object is named (struct, fn, module, etc) 

---

crates are the smallest piece of code the rust compi;er considers at a time
crates can contain modules

two types of crates
binary and library crate
ie executable and shareable code
